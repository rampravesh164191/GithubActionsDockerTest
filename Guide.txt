GitHub Actions 
CI/CD : continuous Integration / continuous delivery(or deployment)

problem statement : let's say team1 is working on feature1 and team2 is working on feature2 and when they push code in the 
github both code is going in the same code base, and we have to deploy that code, but before deployment we want to test 
the code, thats where GitHub Actions come.
- tell github to watch commits or branch eg. tell gitHub Actions to check main branch if any changes, or check this branch etc
- so CI is done by team and CD is done by GitHub Actions
